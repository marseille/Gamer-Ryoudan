searching for "Super Smash Bros. Brawl [Nintendo Wii]" crashes javascript.

Searching on front page does not bring search results to the right

When adding a new game that hasn't been found from a search, red

Adding a new game doesn't work?

-Add a "you are logged in as marseille" widget when logged in. 
-(For when you're already logged in and visit your site directly)
-Values on list aren't editable when not logged in, but they look like they 
  can be
-It doesn't tell you on the site that you're not logged in.

-you really should be able to rank games. Difficult is less cool than a rating,
Who really cares that you played it on hard? or very hard?

-"Found 1 games. Showing 1-20" There were 20? no they weren't.

-Why does "more results" show up if there aren't more results?

-why does it take like 5 seconds to start the page and then afterwards its good?
