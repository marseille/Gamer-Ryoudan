users.games[0].find_info(user.id) 
  => returns custom info for that user and that game

find_info(user.id) =>
  there should be a relationship between users and info
  users have many infos but infos only have one game and one user associated to them
  so.....
  #take self.id, which is game.id, take the user.id
  #look at the join table for game_id, user_id, info_id 
  --and correlate the two to find the info_id
  #query info_table with the info_id and BAM! we got infos
